This is a small demo for ofxOpenNI. Press space to capture a point cloud, then use your hands to sweep through it.

You'll have to copy the contents of ofxOpenNI/mac/copy_to_data_openni_path/ into the bin/data folder; it has been omitted for space reasons.

The simulation is rudimentary and takes the time between frames as the basic time step; try adjusting the damping and reassemblyRate constants to see their effects.
